The concept of Differentially Private Stochastic gradient descent is based on the core idea of Differential Privacy where a user’s data is masked but the mechanism is approximately same. Because of this mechanism, the privacy guarantees that limit the ability of an attacker to distinguish whether a particular individual’s data was included or excluded in the dataset.
